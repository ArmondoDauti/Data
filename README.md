# Schemas On SQL Competency

🗄️ MySQL Database Design & Queries Project

This project demonstrates my ability to design, structure, and query relational databases using MySQL Workbench.

It is divided into two parts, each showing different aspects of database development — from building the schema and relationships to writing SQL queries to retrieve meaningful data.

Part 1 (.mwb) focuses on the database schema design.

Part 2 (.mwb) focuses on writing and executing SQL queries on the designed schema.

⚙️ Part 1 — Database Schema Design

In Part 1, I designed a complete relational database schema using MySQL Workbench.

Key tasks I carried out:

Created tables with appropriate fields, data types, and primary keys

Defined relationships between tables using foreign keys

Ensured referential integrity and normalisation of data

Used ER (Entity-Relationship) diagram modelling to visually represent the database structure

This part demonstrates my ability to plan, structure, and build robust database architectures.

⚙️ Part 2 — SQL Queries & Data Analysis

In Part 2, I built upon the schema to write and run SQL queries that extract meaningful insights from the data.

I worked on:

SELECT statements with filtering, sorting, and conditions (WHERE, ORDER BY)

JOINs (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT) to combine related data across multiple tables

GROUP BY, HAVING, and aggregate functions like COUNT(), SUM(), and AVG()

Subqueries and nested queries for more complex data retrieval

Creating views and using aliases to simplify query outputs

This part showcases my ability to write clean, efficient SQL for real-world data scenarios.
